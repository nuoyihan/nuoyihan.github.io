<span style="font-size: 1.0em;font-weight:bolder;"> Hi! I’m [Violet](https://nuoyihan.github.io). I’m a 1st year PhD student advised by [Professor Alexandra Ion](http://alexandraion.com/) in [Interactive Structures Lab](https://interactive-structures.org/), at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/)’s [Human-Computer Interaction Institute](https://hcii.cmu.edu/).</span> I have also worked with [Professor David Lindlbauer](https://www.davidlindlbauer.com/) in [Augmented Perception Lab](https://augmented-perception.org/).

<span style="font-size: 1.0em;">I am interested in creating <span style = "font-weight:bolder;">novel interfaces (both digital and physical) and their interactions for everyday users in the near future, going beyond the flat screen</span>. I reflect on our daily interactions within the physical and digital domains, to push their boundaries and bring advantages of one into another.</span>

<span style="font-size: 1.0em;">My broad area of research is <span style="font-weight: bolder;">technical Human-Computer Interaction</span>. I currently mostly work in <span style = "font-weight:bolder;">digital fabrication</span> and <span style = "font-weight:bolder;">mixed reality</span>, while also referencing knowledge from other areas, such as computer graphics, human perception, mechanical engineering, and material science.</span>

  <button class="collapsible ontoggle">More about me.</button><span class=details>Outside of research, I spend my time running, gyming, listening to hiphop, cooking, enjoying a variety of sports, sipping on drinks, reading, drawing, seeking karoake, participating in the rad local interest groups and events Pittsburgh has to offer, traveling… and just chilling with my awesome friends and <a href="https://y0mingzhang.github.io/">Yiming</a>.
