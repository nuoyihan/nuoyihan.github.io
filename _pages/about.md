Hi! I’m Violet. I’m a 1st year PhD student advised by [Professor Alexandra Ion](http://alexandraion.com/) in [Interactive Structures Lab](https://interactive-structures.org/), at Carnegie Mellon University’s Human-Computer Interaction Institute. I have also worked with [Professor David Lindlbauer](https://www.davidlindlbauer.com/) in [Augmented Perception Lab](https://augmented-perception.org/).

I am interested in creating novel interfaces (both digital and physical) and their interactions for everyday users in the near future, going beyond the flat screen. I reflect on our daily interactions within the physical and digital domains, to push their boundaries and bring advantages of one into another.

My broad area of research is technical Human-Computer Interaction. I mostly work in digital fabrication and mixed reality, while also referencing knowledge from other areas, such as computer graphics, human perception, mechanical engineering, and material science.
