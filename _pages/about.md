<span style="font-size: 1.0em;font-weight:bolder;"> Hi! I’m [Violet](https://nuoyihan.github.io). I’m a 3rd year PhD student advised by [Professor Alexandra Ion](http://alexandraion.com/) in [Interactive Structures Lab](https://interactive-structures.org/), at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/)’s [Human-Computer Interaction Institute](https://hcii.cmu.edu/).</span> I have also worked with [Professor David Lindlbauer](https://www.davidlindlbauer.com/) in [Augmented Perception Lab](https://augmented-perception.org/) as a Masters student.


<span style="font-size: 1.0em;font-weight:bolder;">Instead of adding robots to our world that automate tasks, what if our world itself can become robotic and intelligent? </span><span style="font-size: 1.0em;">My research explores <span style = "font-weight:bolder;">intelligent, robotically augmented everyday environments</span> that <span style = "font-weight:bolder;">enhance
rather than replace human experiences.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 1.0em;">I build (1) physical systems that integrate into existing objects and environments, enabling multimodal
input/output capabilities such as robotic manipulation, movement, and tactile display, and (2) digital systems
that understand users and facilitate interactions through interaction intent inference and proactive assistance.</span>

  <span class=details>
    Outside of research, I spend my time running, gyming, listening to hiphop, cooking, enjoying a variety of sports, sipping on drinks, reading, drawing, seeking karoake, participating in the rad local interest groups and events Pittsburgh has to offer, traveling… and just chilling with my awesome friends and <a href="https://y0mingzhang.github.io/">Yiming</a>. 
    <br><br>
    Hit me up for sports, coffee, drinks, and karaoke :<span>&#41;</span>

    Recently I am excited for the <a href ="https://www.thepittsburghmarathon.com/races/half-marathon-1">Pittsburgh 2024 half marathon</a>!
