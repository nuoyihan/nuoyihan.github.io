<span style="font-size: 1.03em;font-weight:bolder;"> Hi! I’m [Violet](https://nuoyihan.github.io).

<span style="font-size: 1.03em; "><span style = "font-weight:bolder;">I’m a 1st year PhD student advised by [Professor Alexandra Ion](http://alexandraion.com/) in [Interactive Structures Lab](https://interactive-structures.org/), at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/)’s [Human-Computer Interaction Institute](https://hcii.cmu.edu/).</span> I have also worked with [Professor David Lindlbauer](https://www.davidlindlbauer.com/) in [Augmented Perception Lab](https://augmented-perception.org/).</span>

<span style="font-size: 1.03em;">I am interested in creating <span style = "font-weight:bolder;">novel interfaces (both digital and physical) and their interactions for everyday users in the near future, going beyond the flat screen</span>. I reflect on our daily interactions within the physical and digital domains, to push their boundaries and bring advantages of one into another.</span>

<span style="font-size: 1.03em;">My broad area of research is <span style="font-weight: bolder;">technical Human-Computer Interaction</span>. I currently mostly work in <span style = "font-weight:bolder;">digital fabrication</span> and <span style = "font-weight:bolder;">mixed reality</span>, while also referencing knowledge from other areas, such as computer graphics, human perception, mechanical engineering, and material science.</span>
